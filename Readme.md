# WT TEST DRIVER

A Gui for test driving any WarThunder vehicle based on [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbFSo0YqJE0)


## Installation

make sure to install python

## Usage/Examples

I would suggest you watch [Ask3lad's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbFSo0YqJE0) before running this as it may help with troubleshooting issues later on

On first startup the program checks if you have Wt installed with WT launcher if not it will prompt you for your warthunder install directory e.g. **C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Local\WarThunder** or the steam install directory e.g. **A:\Steam\steamapps\common\War Thunder**, 

It will then prompt you for a custom mission file if you have followed [Ask3lad's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbFSo0YqJE0) it will be ask3lad_testdrive.blk located in **\UserMissions\Ask3lad** in the warthunder directory. (these paths can be changed by editing or deleting the config). On first startup The default value for last selected vehicle is **ussr_pantsyr_s1** as this is what is used in the video, if you have already edited your custom mission and **us_m2a4.blk** files either edit them back to the **ussr_pantsyr_s1** or edit the config value to whatever value you have already set

After startup you just select whatever vehicle you want from the dropdowns, load into the user mission and enjoy.
